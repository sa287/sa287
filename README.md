### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Subhan, I am a recent computer science graduate from Heriot-Watt University, currently seeking a full-time career that will allow me to utilize my newly acquired knowledge and skillset.

  My GitHub profile will mainly contain projects from my degree (including my dissertation), so you can expect to see repos containing the following languages or 
  projects:
  
    - Java (object-orientated examples, advanced data structures and algorithms, interfaces etc.)
    - Python including data modeling and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit).
    - OCaml 
    - Dissertation: 'Using Machine Learning in Financial Risk'.
    - Front-end Web Development: HTML, PHP, CSS, and Bootstrap code.
    - Back-end Web Development: Node.js, D3.js, and other Javascript elements.
